This repository contains a collection of mini-projects I’ve worked on as I begin my journey into Cloud Computing using Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## 🌐 About

Cloud Computing is the on-demand availability of computing resources like servers, storage, networking, and databases without direct physical management. AWS (Amazon Web Services) is one of the leading platforms in this field, offering a wide range of scalable and cost-effective cloud services.

As a student exploring AWS, I’ve created this space to document my hands-on experience with basic AWS services such as EC2, IAM, S3, CloudFormation, and more. These projects are designed to help me understand the core concepts of cloud infrastructure, deployment, and automation.

## 🧩 Purpose of This Repository

- 📚 To track and document the cloud projects I complete
- 🛠️ To practice setting up cloud infrastructure using real AWS services
- 🚀 To build a solid foundation for my future career as a Cloud Engineer or Developer
- 📁 To organize each project into clear, structured folders with READMEs and screenshots

## 📁 Projects

This repository will include multiple subfolders, each representing a different AWS project. Each folder will have:
- A clear description of the project
- Screenshots showing key steps
- Notes on what I learned

---

📝 This repository is a part of my continuous learning path. As I gain more knowledge and hands-on experience, I’ll continue to add and improve projects here.
